  The C Programming Language (sometimes termed K&R, after its authors' initials)
  is a computer programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie,
  the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the C programming
  language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which
  development of the language was closely intertwined. The book was central to
  the development and popularization of C and is still widely read and used
  today[when?]. Because the book was co-authored by the original language
  designer, and because the first edition of the book served for many years as
  the de facto standard for the language, the book was regarded by many to be
  the authoritative reference on C.[1][2]
